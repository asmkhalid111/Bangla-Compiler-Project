# Bangla Compiler Project

-- Created by Ashrafuzzaman Khalid

A compiler for a simple programming language with Bangla (Bengali) keywords, built in C++ using Flex and Bison for a university course.

## Features

- Bangla keywords: `লেট` (let), `প্রিন্ট` (print)
- Bangla identifiers and numerals (e.g., `৫` for 5)
- Supports variable assignments and basic arithmetic

## Setup

1. Install Flex, Bison, and g++.
2. Run `flex lexer.l` to generate the lexer.
3. (Future steps for parser and interpreter)
